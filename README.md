## Homework 11

This week we have a written part and an implementation part. 

### Written part 

Answer the questions found in `main.tex` and turn your answers in by uploading them 
back here before midnight on the due date. You may do this as many times as 
you want. Only your final submission counts.

Remember this is math class so be sure to justify your answers. You will be 
graded on correctness and proper justification.

Note: when you submit, your filename must be `solutions.pdf` and it must be a pdf. 

### Implementation part 

You have some basic API for elliptic curves and their points in `ec/basic.go`. 
You should fill in some more methods, including computing multiples, orders, and 
listing all points on a given curve modulo N.
